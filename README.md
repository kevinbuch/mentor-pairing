##### Setting up Auth
Pairing is Caring uses Dev Bootcamp as it's primary auth provider. If you don't
want to hit auth.devbootcamp.com as you smoke test locally you may instead use
the omniauth developer strategy by visiting `localhost:3000/auth/developer` and
filling in the required `provider` and `id` fields.
